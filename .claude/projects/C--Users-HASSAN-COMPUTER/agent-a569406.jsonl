If you could provide a project directory or specific files to look at, I could help analyze them and suggest a warmup approach based on the actual codebase.\n\nIf you'd like me to demonstrate with a hypothetical example, please let me know what type of project or technology stack you're interested in exploring.\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n- N/A (No specific project files available to identify)"}],"model":"qwen3-coder-plus","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"5468aad0-580f-4c93-9367-744e1f42aa2e","timestamp":"2025-12-16T21:21:30.292Z"}
