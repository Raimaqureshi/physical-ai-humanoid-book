# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular, Structured, University-Grade Content
The textbook MUST be modular, structured, and adhere to university-grade standards for academic rigor and presentation.

### II. Course Document Adherence
Content MUST strictly follow the provided course document, ensuring complete and accurate coverage of specified topics.

### III. Consistent Module Structure
Each module MUST contain exactly four (4) chapters to maintain a predictable and manageable learning pace.

### IV. Comprehensive Chapter Content
Each chapter MUST include: Concept explanation, Real-world robotics examples, ROS 2 / Gazebo / Isaac references, Clearly defined learning objectives, and Practical exercises.

### V. AI-Native Features & Accessibility
The system MUST support:
*   AI-powered Q&A via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   Chapter-level personalization for diverse learning paths
*   Urdu translation for broader accessibility
*   Content explanation adaptable to user background and prior knowledge.

## Guiding Personas & Alignment

**Guiding Personas:** Content and design MUST reflect the perspectives of:
*   A robotics professor (academic rigor, pedagogical soundness)
*   An AI startup founder (practical application, innovation, scalability)
*   A curriculum designer (learning flow, clarity, assessment)

**Strict Alignment:** All content MUST align with and emphasize: Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action.

## Content Integrity

Content generation MUST NEVER hallucinate or introduce information outside the provided course scope.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All content changes MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity in implementation MUST be justified by pedagogical or technical necessity. Version bumping will follow semantic versioning rules: MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications.
